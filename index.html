    <p>
        I started my art journey at the age of 10, exploring various mediums and techniques. 
        My first formal training began at an art school in India during summer vacations, and I continued honing my skills for six years at an art school in the Bay Area. 
        I initially learned the fundamentals—drawing, sketching, and shading—experimenting with pencil and charcoal. 
        However, I truly fell in love with art through the vibrant and expressive process of painting.

    I began with acrylics but was captivated by the depth and richness of oil painting. 
    I also enjoyed working with watercolors and still carry a small, portable palette with me in college! 
    Over the years, I have created artwork for family and friends, painting landscapes, animals, food, mythology, characters, and travel destinations.

        At 14, I was honored to paint a mural for the Humane Society, using my art to support my local community. 
        Later, I donated a painting to a UNICEF auction, where my work raised over $500 in funds. 
        While art has remained a beloved hobby, it has always been a source of creativity, stress relief, and positivity in my life. 
        Sharing my work has allowed me to give back to others and connect with my community in meaningful ways. 
        Even now, I'm thrilled to see my paintings displayed in the homes of my family and friends knowing that I share something I love so much with the 
        people I love most.
