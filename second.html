        Here are some of the paintings I have painted. This watercolor painting is the first painting I made when I was 10.
        Working with an instructor, I drew the landscape, adding color and depth after using an image of the scene as inspiration.

        This painting was made using acrylic paint and depicts the Hindu God, Ganesha. He is said to bring prosperity and abundance. I made this 
        painting for my grandparents early in my art career.

       I made the peacock paintings for my parents using acrylic paint. I made the butterfly painting for my young cousin as a birthday 
       gift. Cumulatively, I worked on these paintings for over 95 hours.

    <p> I decided to experiment by painting realistic life. Displayed below is one of my first oil paintings. I learned blending techniques
        and how to play with light. </p>

    <p> This is my favorite painting and it is made using oil paints. It depicts a beautiful beach sunset I had seen while exploring the California coast. </p>

    <p> Although I do not paint as much as I once used to, I find that the techniques easily come back to me when I pick up my 
        paintbrushes again. I love to carry my portable palette and spend time painting with friends at different locations around the world. 
        I especially loved learning art both abroad and at home because it was exciting to see the similarity and differences! The philosophy 
        of art will always stay with me. As my art teacher Mr. Armando always said, "No erasers! We make mistakes, and we learn to incorporate 
        them into our beautiful masterpieces."
